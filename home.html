        <a href="http://www.gnoosic.com/">Gnoosic</a> 
        <a>- A lot of times when you’re bored you just want to do stuff that’s pretty much useless,
             but still a lot of fun. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, Patatap fits
              the bill perfectly. This website does one thing — plays sounds and animations based on 
              the keys you’re pressing on your computer’s keyboard. So, you can start typing out random 
              lines on your keyboard and Patatap will reward you with an explosion of fun sounds and animations.
               It sounds a little ridiculous, but it’s very addictive, especially if you enjoy typing.</a> <br> <br>

        <a href="http://www.flashbynight.com/drench/">Drench</a>
        <a>- Browser games can be a lot of fun, and Drench is one browser game that’s sure to help you kill hours 
             in one go. In Drench, you basically get a board full of different colors and you have to ‘drench’ the 
             entire board in one single color. The challenge is that you only get a limited number of turns to finish
             the board, so you have to think carefully about how you’ll proceed with the objective. It’s a fun way 
             to pass some time on your computer, and once you get the hang of it, it’s quite calming as well… for 
             some strange reason. </a> <br> <br>

        <a href="https://riverstyx.com/">Riverstyx</a>
        <a>- Are you interested in Greek mythology? Even if you aren’t, honestly, this website will make you interested.
             River Styx is a Greek mythological underworld. The eponymously named website takes you through an interactive 
             tour of the river and the underworld, where you will meet a lot of Greek gods and goddesses. The experience is 
             very much like a point and click game where you click on relevant icons and objects to reveal information and 
             more. It’s a fun, and educational, way to spend free time online. </a><br>
